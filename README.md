# Water Sort Puzzle

Port to MAUI from my [previous project](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.svira.WaterSortPuzzle) that only run on Windows through WPF.

## This is still work in progress!


App is available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.svira.WaterSortPuzzle), but since its still in closed testing phase it only available to people who first join [this Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/rasv-app-testing).
Please note that your email address will be visible to the developer (me).

Note that after joining the group it takes a second before you are able to access the Google Play page. Sometimes its required to close the page and reopen again from the [link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.svira.WaterSortPuzzle).
